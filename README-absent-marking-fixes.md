# Automatic Absent Marking System - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed Syntax Errors in `create-test-data.ps1`**
   - Corrected JavaScript template literal syntax in PowerShell here-strings
   - Changed backtick template literals to string concatenation for compatibility with PowerShell
   - Verified the script now runs correctly and creates test data in Firebase

2. **Added Dedicated Firebase Admin Initialization Module**
   - Created `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` to properly handle server-side Firebase initialization
   - Improved error handling and logging for Firebase setup issues
   - Separated client and server Firebase configurations

## Implementation Details

### 1. Attendance Policy Logic
The system now correctly implements the attendance policy:
- 0-15 minutes after class start = Present
- 16 minutes to class end = Late
- After class end = Absent

This is handled through the following calculations:
- `sessionStart`: The class start time
- `gracePeriodEnd`: 15 minutes after start time
- `sessionEnd`: The class end time

The system determines student status based on when the check is performed:
- `isAfterGracePeriod`: After grace period but before class end → Mark as LATE
- `isAfterClassEnded`: After class end → Mark as ABSENT

### 2. Notification System Integration
- Different notifications are created based on attendance status:
  - Late status: Warning notification (yellow)
  - Absent status: Error notification (red)
- Notifications include helpful context (class name, date, time)
- Notifications are viewable in the NotificationCenter component

## Testing
To test the system:
1. Run `.\create-test-data.ps1.fixed` to generate test data
2. Wait until the session end time
3. Run `.\trigger-cron.ps1` to trigger the absent marking process
4. Check Firebase for new attendance and notification records

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/autoMarkAbsents/route.ts` - Updated the API route with improved Firebase handling
- `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` - New file for server-side Firebase admin SDK initialization
- `create-test-data.ps1` - Fixed syntax issues with template literals
- Various PowerShell support scripts for testing and debugging

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the system in production to ensure it correctly marks students based on the attendance policy
2. Consider adding a configuration option to adjust the grace period (currently fixed at 15 minutes)
3. Add email notifications for absent students (in addition to in-app notifications)
